# Project Transformation

This assignment was a great way to learn how to convert a static site into a responsive site. Responsive sites are the current trend and are basically expected in the web design industry today, so it is a great skill to know.

## Resources

* [HTML5 Boiler Plate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169) was used to help style out some of the HTML structure elements with the "visuallyhidden" class to keep the design clean.

* Other than what is listed above, I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

### Comments

The one thing I absolutely loved about this assignment was learning how to take an already pre-built static website and convert it to a responsive site. I have been wanting to do this very thing with all the websites I have built, but never knew where to start. Now I do!
